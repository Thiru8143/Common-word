COMMON WORD

This project is a simple JavaScript-based application that processes a paragraph of text to identify the top three most frequently used words. The output is displayed on the web page and also logged in the console.



 How It Works

1. The script processes a predefined paragraph:
   - Converts the text to lowercase for case-insensitive counting.
   - Removes punctuation and special characters to focus only on the words.
   - Splits the text into an array of words.
2. A word count is performed to calculate the frequency of each word.
3. The top three most common words and their counts are displayed on the webpage in the format: word (count).

 Technologies Used

- *HTML*: Structure for the web page.
- *JavaScript*: Logic for processing the paragraph, counting the frequency of words, and displaying the output.
